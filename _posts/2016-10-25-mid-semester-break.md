## I'm Not Good at Blogging About My Life

Again, I apologize for taking so long to update my blog. It's been almost two months since the last time I posted and I know that's way too long for any good blogger to wait before posting. Good thing I'm not actually a professional blogger. Anyone who knows me at all knows I'm not really into social media or sharing my life publicly, so this whole blog thing just kinda slipped my mind for the past two months. Fortunately, the fact that I've been so busy means that I've been having an awesome time here! So let<!-- more --> me give you a brief overview of the major highlights of the past two months.

As I mentioned in my last post, I'm not much of a picture-taker. It's just something I don't really think about when I'm out and about unless I see other people taking pictures. And then I'm like, "oh yeah, I should take a picture!" So I'll go ahead and add whatever I can to my photo gallery.

Additionally, I'm going to go ahead and emphasize how much I underestimated the difficulty of classes here. I guess I shouldn't be surprised that computer engineering is going to be hard wherever you go. There was a solid two or three week stretch before the break where I just spent every day working on projects or studying for tests. So when the break came around, I was so relieved. Speaking of the break...

## Non-Teaching Period (AKA Spring Break)

At Melbourne Uni, there's a week break in the spring semester (don't forget spring and fall are opposite here) that they call "non-teaching period." This is a break that the teachers claim means "you don't have lectures but that doesn't mean you shouldn't work on assignments." Yeah right. Nobody's going to stay at home and do work for an entire week when there's so much traveling to be done! It's essentially just an Australian Spring Break. For mine, I decided to join the UniGames Softball team. UniGames is an event where all the major universities in Australia come together at the end of September in one city and compete in a bunch of different sports. Every other year it's in Gold Coast in Queensland, but this year it was in Perth in Western Australia. Being one of the largest universities in Australia, Melbourne Uni sent teams for almost every sport imaginable. UniGames is supposed to be competitive, but much more about fun than winning. There are theme parties every night and tons of fun things organized for all the players. I had a ton of fun, and our team came in 4th place out of seven teams. All the new girls on the team who had never been to UniGames before were called "rookies." So every night, the vets (girls who had been before) would assign the girl who wins "rookiest rookie," which means they screwed something up worse than any other rookie that day. The rookiest rookie would have to wear a giant loofah costume for that night's theme party. So inevitably, I won this prestigious award on Thursday night after losing my accreditation and having to go to downtown Perth to get a new one printed out, causing me to miss a really important game. Scroll down to see a picture of me wearing said loofah outfit, it's pretty hilarious. Perth was really beautiful, and I got to go take a dip in the Indian Ocean. It was less of a dip and more of a polar plunge, because it was freezing near the beach. Check out some pictures from the trip:

## The Coming Months

After my last final on November 14, I will finally have some time to explore this awesome city I've been living in for more than three months. School has been a priority since I've been here and it's been tough, so I'm excited to finally have some time to move away from the "study" and more toward the "abroad." I've actually planned a trip in early December through Bali, Thailand, and Singapore which is going to be great! And before that I might be going on a quick trip to Tasmania and will definitely be exploring all that Melbourne has to offer, so check back at the end of November and I'll do my best to provide a more detailed update of what I've been up to. And I'll try harder to take more pictures!
