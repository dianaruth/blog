## First Week of School

Australians have a very casual approach to university. Things are super chill compared to universities in America, so I wasn't too surprised by the fact that I had literally nothing to do the entire first week of school. Each class generally consists of two lectures per week and one tutorial, which is like a lab or a discussion. Each class is worth the same amount of credit, which is<!-- more --> different from the U.S. where a class could be worth anywhere between 1 and 6 credit hours. Since it was the first week, all of my tutorials were canceled and I just had to go to lectures. I had no homework and basically nothing to do. Of course, this all changed when I started my second week. Tutorials all started up and I've already got a massive pile of homework waiting for me. Luckily enough, I managed to have no classes or tutorials on Wednesdays so that will likely turn into my catch-up day.

Because Wednesday is my free day and the first week was so relaxed, two of my friends and I took a trip to the beach. In the middle of winter. But I grew up no less than five hours from the beach so I thought it would be a lot of fun just to see the ocean. Of course, it was absolutely freezing when we got there but I was just so happy to finally see the ocean after two weeks of living in a waterfront city and never having seen it.

We then had lunch at a little Italian restaurant and got back right before a big storm rolled in.

The best decision I've made since I've been here is joining the Melbourne University Softball Club. I've been playing softball since I was eight years old and I haven't had a chance to do it much since I started college. So I heard that UoM had a softball team and I joined as soon as I could. We had practice on the first Wednesday of school where I met a lot of the girls, and they're some of the friendliest people I've ever met. They say that after practice they just chill and go to the pub to get drinks. Such and Australian thing. It's nice to play in a semi-competitive environment without having that much pressure to win or perform flawlessly.

I was assigned to a team for the double-header they had that weekend, so thus I became a member of the Melbourne University Raptors. The league allows players of any age, so we played against people anywhere from 14 years old to 60 years old. We lost both games, but it was just so much fun to meet new people playing a sport I've always loved (and of course we went to the pub after the game).

So I'm slowly but surely settling in to my life here in Melbourne. I'm trying to join a few more clubs to meet new people but I'm really enjoying myself so far. Classes are going well and I'm ready for the weather to warm up!
