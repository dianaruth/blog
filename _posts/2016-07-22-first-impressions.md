## The Journey
I've been here for about five days now and there's a lot to tell. My first flight on Friday went from Dallas to Los Angeles, and I almost missed my main flight to Sydney. But when I ran up to the desk to ask about a first class upgrade (courtesy of my mother's high American Airlines status) it turns out<!-- more --> I got it! So I flew in style to Sydney in business class for 15 hours with a seat that retracted completely into a bed. It was amazing. Then I took one last flight from Sydney to Melbourne and arrived around noon local time. Here, I'm 15 hours ahead of the central time zone.

Then I made my way, very slowly, to my new apartment. Some guy from Singapore ended up leaving a bag at the airport so we had to take an hour long detour to go get it. So when I finally got to the apartment I was completely exhausted from traveling. Australia is apparently one of the most environmentally conscious countries in the world, which I, as an American, am not used to. My building has no A/C or heating and wherever there is a heater it shuts off automatically after 30 minutes. The internet is also limited and I blew through my monthly internet allowance in the first two days I was here. So I definitely have some adapting to do.

I live in a four bedroom apartment and one of my roommates is the RA for our floor. Her name is Syia (pronounced "sha") and she's from Malaysia. She took me grocery shopping and out to lunch on my first day there and she's very nice. My other two roommates are Chinese graduate students and Syia said they keep to themselves. Which is fine, I don't need to be best friends with my roommates, but it will be quite a change since I'm used to being best friends with my roommates. My room is small but pretty nice. I've got everything I need. Here's the view from my eighth floor apartment:

I also tried an Australian staple. 10/10 would recommend.

## Becoming Oriented
On Monday I had exchange student orientation, where I met two American girls - one from Hawaii and one from Connecticut. We spent the day learning about the University of Melbourne and all it has to offer. Then we went to an event for exchange students at a bar about a mile from the university.

## Night Market
On Wednesday night we went to the Queen Victoria Market's special Night Market. They run it every Wednesday night from June to August and it's a cool place with food and craft stalls. My roommate even tried a kangaroo burger from an Australian exotic food stand.

She said it doesn't taste far off from beef, so there you have it. Maybe I'll give it a try when I gather the courage. The market is really close to downtown and has a great atmosphere.

After the market, we wandered downtown and went to a cool gelato stand that makes their gelato with liquid nitrogen. I split a cool looking one with my friend and it tasted amazing.

On our walk back, we saw some pretty cool scenery as well. If I had to compare Melbourne to another city, I would say it's a strange mix of the DC area, Montreal, and Austin. The architecture is very old and Victorian, but it's cultural and home to a lot of foreigners like Montreal. And it's got lots of cool hipster spots just like Austin.

Today I went on a tour of a nearby town called Fitzroy, which is known as the hipster part of Melbourne. We went to a gelato shop and then looked at some really cool street art along the walls. The weather wasn't great, but there were a lot of cool sights. Melbourne has some incredible architecture.

So that catches us up to today! I've had a great experience so far and I'm hoping to meet more people when school starts. I'm also going to include an Aussie word-of-the-day with every post so I can share the crazy slang with you all. This video is pretty funny as well:
