## Apologies

I apologize for the long wait in putting up another post. School got busy much more quickly than I had anticipated and I've been hard at work trying to keep up. There's much more "study" in the study abroad right now. I'm also not much of a picture taker, so I wanted to make sure I had some good pictures to share before putting up another post.

Things have been going really well over here. Making friends and adapting to a new environment is always hard, even at the ripe old age of 22. Most of the other students here<!-- more --> are at least 2 years younger than me (and most of them are more focused on drinking than anything else) so I've had to spend some time finding like-minded people. I've got a few friends from classes and a couple that live in my apartment complex. I also get along really well with the girls on the softball team, mostly because they're all in their late 20s and 30s and I'm an old soul.

## MU Softball

I mentioned in my last post that I had joined the softball team here, which is a sport I've been playing since I was eight years old. The team I played for wasn't exactly a winning team, but they were the nicest group of ladies I've ever met and it was amazing getting to know them and hang out with them for the last couple months. Additionally, I signed up for an event over the non-teaching period (aka Australian spring break) called UniGames, which is kind of like the Australian university olympics. Teams for a bunch of different sports from a bunch of Australian universities get together in one city to face off in their sport. And drink a lot apparently. It's not at all surprising that the Australians take sports tournaments so casually, but it should be a really fun event and I'm excited to be a part of it.

## A quick overview of some things I did in August

### Sherwood Falls Hiking Trip

At the beginning of the month, some friends and I took a trip to the Sherwood National Forest for some nature time. It was a very cool rainforest-like place with a little waterfall which we thought would be more impressive but was still quite pretty. It was nice to get out of the city and be able to see some of the natural beauty of the Melbourne area.

### The Footy

Australian Football is a big deal in Melbourne. It's essentially a sport that was invented in Victoria that is played almost exclusively in Victoria that nobody else in the world plays, but Melbournians take it as seriously as we take the Super Bowl in the States. It's kind of a cross between soccer and rugby and makes the American football players look like lazy bums. Check out this video (that was shown to me during orientation) to learn more about this sport:

Since I'm living in Victoria, of course I had to try "the footy." I went to my first game with the softball girls, which was great because they're Australian and explained all the crazy rules to me. I even got a Western Bulldogs scarf to wear so I could try to fit in with the footy-obsessed fans all around me. There's a lot of drinking and a lot of screaming involved, and the fans get really into it.

I went to my second and third games with some friends, and both were at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, which was a location used in the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. That place is absolutely huge. Going to the footy is a great time and I'm glad I was here during the season to experience it.

### Other Things

The weather has still been cold, rainy, and cloudy but hopefully that will change soon. Classes also finally picked up and I've got my first test this Thursday, followed by three more tests and four projects in the next two weeks. I've been to a few parties, a charity dinner, and have spent a lot of time exploring different parts of the city. I'm hoping I can keep a good balance between classes and fun in the coming weeks!
